# Dogs Challenge

Welcome to the Dogs Challenge!

We have a small react application that fetches a list of dog breeds and subbreeds.
It renders them in a list, and lets the user click one to display some random pictures of the dog.

## The Task

Our PM isn't very happy with the UX of the app and has asked that you implement an autocomplete/typehead so that is easier for the users to find the dog breed they are looking for.

- As a user, I want to be able to click on my choice from a list of suggestions that match what I've typed so far.
- As a user, I want to be able to hit 'Enter' to select the suggestion.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate the suggestions using arrow keys.

You've heard that we will need similar functionality in another part of the application, so this component should be reusable.

She's also not pleased with the way images are rendered on the screen. They are all different sizes, and it would be much nicer if they uniformly arranged in a grid.
